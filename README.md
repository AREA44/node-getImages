# CRJ - Creat a JSON file list of Images

This code will create a JSON file called `images.json` in the current directory. The JSON file will contain a list of all the image files in the `images` folder. The key of each object in the JSON file will be the name of the image file, and the value will be the path to the image file.

```sh
node index.js
```
